    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly lab session has two components: questions and discussion (not using the computer) about recent material, and a lab assignment (like this one!) that develops skills with computational and inferential concepts. In addition to that, you will get familiar with Python, interact with LLMs and learn how to write useful prompts, all while analyzing data! These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Fridays during lab time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab sessions are not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or a ULA (peer tutor) for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though."

    "\n",
    "##### Text cells\n",
    "In a notebook, each rectangle containing text or code is called a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cells (like this one) can be edited by double-clicking on them. They're written in a simple format called Markdown to add formatting and section headings. You don't need to learn Markdown, but you might want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you edit a text cell, click the \"run cell\" button at the top that looks like ▶| or hold down shift + return to confirm any changes. (**Try not to delete the instructions of the lab.**)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code cells\n",
    "Other cells contain code in the Python 3 language. Running a code cell will execute all of the code it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in a code cell, first click on that cell to activate it. It'll be highlighted with a little green or blue rectangle. Next, either press ▶| or hold down shift + return.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### AI cells with magic commands\n",
    "In this course, we will be using OpenAI's gpt-4 model. These cells start with `%%ai openai-chat:gpt-4` and are followed by a `prompt` in the next line that works as an input to ChatGPT. This prompt will be sent to the AI assistant which will then respond with an output based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please avoid using extremely lengthy and unnecessary prompts. **Do not change the magic command** and always use `%%ai openai-chat:gpt-4` in this course. In case of rate limiting, you are also allowed to use '%%ai openai-chat:gpt-3.5-turbo' instead. Finalize and submit all your prompts that helped you solve the questions as part of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Kernel\n",
    "The kernel is a program that executes the code inside your notebook and outputs the results. In the top right of your window, you can see a circle that indicates the status of your kernel. If the circle is empty (⚪), the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in (⚫), the kernel is busy running some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to every code cell, you'll see some text that says In [...]. Before you run the cell, you'll see In [ ]. When the cell is running, you'll see In [`*`]. If you see an asterisk (`*`) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: In [1]. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into problems where your kernel is stuck for an excessive amount of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its connection. If this happens, try the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of your screen, click Kernel, then Interrupt Kernel.\n",
    "If that doesn't help, click Kernel, then Restart Kernel. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking File at the top left of your screen, then Save Notebook. Next, click File, then Hub Control Panel. Choose Stop My Server to shut it down, then Start My Server to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on. You'll still have to run your code cells again.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to submit your work\n",
    "- Make sure you save the notebook first,\n",
    "- Make sure you have run all the cells (Using Run -> Run All Cells or clicking the button at the top that looks like ▶▶). Carefully look through your notebook and verify that all computations execute correctly. You should see no errors; if there are any errors, make sure to correct them before you submit the notebook.\n",
    "- Scroll up to check all cells have a number next to them, e.g, [35]. \n",
    "- Then, go to File -> Download and download the notebook to your own computer. (Please verify that it got saved as an `.ipynb` file.)\n",
    "- Upload the notebook to Gradescope."
