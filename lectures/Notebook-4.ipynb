       "| Block2 | Green |\n",
       "| Block3 | Blue  |\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, you can use the `join` method to combine these sets and find blocks that have both a specific shape and color. Suppose you want to find blocks that are both \"Circle\" shaped and \"Red\" colored. You can do it like this:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "shapes_table = Table().with_columns('Block', make_array('Block1', 'Block2', 'Block3'),\n",

       "combined_table = shapes_table.join('Block', colors_table)\n",
       "matched_blocks = combined_table.where('Shape', 'Circle').where('Color', 'Red')\n",

       "\n",
       "After doing the join and filtering the desired shape and color, the `matched_blocks` table will look like this:\n",

       "Here, you have joined the two tables based on the common attribute \"Block\" and found the block that is both \"Circle\" shaped and \"Red\" colored.\n",
